Here we mainly focuses on the simulation design of a DC to DC convertor using the simulation tool called MULTISIM. This converter is used to amplify a 24VDC input to a 48 VDC output and maintains a maximum power of 500W. Its application includes Aero-spatial domain especially in satellites, here it is combined with the energetic system beside the fuel cells, hydrogen and oxygen regeneration systems or in the photovoltaic cells. This circuit uses a PWM with a switching frequency of 5 kHz and a linear variable voltage generator using 555 circuit. This electronic scheme is improved, and the input and the output voltages are modified based on the avionics standards. The behavior of the convertor under different loads - 15 Ω and 35 Ω is observed and the results are noted to be are consistent.
