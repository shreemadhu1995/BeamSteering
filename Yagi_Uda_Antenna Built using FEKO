Abstract
The project under the title “Designed the Yagi-Uda Antenna with enhancement in Gain for Wi-fi and Wi-max application” mainly describes different ways to design Yagi-Uda antenna with required Gain. The Wi-fi and Wi-max technologies are becoming more popular in recent years, these technologies basically use various patch antennas. The Wi-fi and Wi-max technologies require the use of an antenna with Higher Gain and Directivity. But the major downside of using Patch antenna is its lower Gain, lower power handling capability and lower Directivity. To overcome this downside Conventional Yagi-Uda antenna with higher Directivity and Gain can be used. The Yagi-Uda antennas can be designed in a way that increases Gain and Directivity that suits the needs of the Wi-fi and Wi-max technologies. This project mainly focuses on the design of various Yagi-Uda antenna with enhanced Gain and Directivity. The Gain of Yagi-Uda antenna can be enhanced by one of the two methods, firstly by increasing the number of Directors and Secondly by increasing the spacing between the directors. These Yagi-Uda antennas are designed using a FEKO simulation tool and the simulation results show the enhancement in the Gain and Directivity.  
The Files  yagiuda(more Sad).cfs is has the Design with lasge spacing between the directors where Sad is the spacing between the directors and yagiuda(more directors).cfs has the Antenna designed with more number of Directors containd the Yagi Uda antenna with enhanced Gain and Bandwidth.
